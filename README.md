Description:
This project implements a remote-controlled robot car using an ATmega32 microcontroller as the main processing unit. The robot's movement is controlled wirelessly via Bluetooth using a smartphone app. The HC-05 Bluetooth module facilitates communication between the smartphone and the microcontroller. The L293D motor driver interfaces with the ATmega32 to control the robot's DC motors, enabling forward, backward, left, and right movements.

Key Components:
- ATmega32 microcontroller
- HC-05 Bluetooth module
- L293D motor driver
- DC motors (2x)
- Robot chassis
- Power supply (battery pack)
 -Wheels

Main Features:
- Wireless control via Bluetooth
- Four-directional movement (forward, backward, left, right)
- Smartphone app for user interface
- Real-time responsiveness to commands
